		Considering that our smartphones, no matter what operating system they run, end up performing a lot of the day-to-day tasks we now take for granted it’s no surprise that they have a lot of access to a lot of data. Android is an incredible example of how easily users will surrender their personal information without looking into just why or what these permissions are needed for. We use third-party contact apps that have full access to our address books, games that have full access to our data connections and other key areas of our devices that they don’t seem to need. Google Now users on Android offer up their location data and pretty much everything else for some convenience, and while it’s arguable that companies such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter can de trusted other developers with apps in the Play Store might not be quite as trustworthy. 

		With worldwide surveillance and data breaches such as the terrible iCloud hack that exposed countless celebrities, it’s no wonder that users are starting to think a little harder about the information they share freely online. Where the smartphone is concerned, encrypted messaging apps like Telegram have become popular, and apps that allow users to lock away certain files or apps behind a PIN or password have become more common as well. Fingerprint sensors have adorned the majority of flagship Android smartphones from 2015, with Google leading the way with the [Nexus 6P](http://www.androidheadlines.com/2015/10/featured-review-google-nexus-6p-2015.html)  and [Nexus 5X](http://www.androidheadlines.com/2015/10/featured-review-google-nexus-5x.html) and while that’s great, it all depends on apps and user behavior. With the latest version of Android, dubbed Marshmallow, Google is looking to fix this once and for all.

		How permissions used to work in Android 5.1 Lollipop and below compared to Android 6.0 Marshmallow and above was that the Play Store app would tell you what permissions an app or game would need and you would grant them all when installing an app. Now, things are different, and an app will only ask for permission to a key part of your device when it needs it. The simplest example is something like an instant messenger like WhatsApp or Google’s own Hangouts, they’ll need to ask for access to your Contacts to start a conversation, but it might not ever ask for permission to your Location data or your Microphone and Camera. It will ask for your Location data if and when you choose to share your Location with a contact or something similar.

		This fresh approach is great for users, as it finally offers them at least some sort of education as to why certain apps have certain access to certain aspects of their device and their data. For developers however, this new approach has provided them with a fresh challenge; how to ask for this data at the right times and how to educate their users as to why they need this access. Google does a great job of explaining some of this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZqDdvhTZj0)

		I am no developer. I am however, someone that users a lot of different apps and reviews them for Android Headlines. I often come across permission lists in the Play Store for apps and games that make even me scratch my head. For instance, why does Kabam’s Star Wars: Uprising need access to my Phone Status to ‘read phone status and identity’? I see no reason why such an app needs access to say, my IMEI number or something similar, and as big a Star Wars fan I am I might not install this game after seeing this. With Marshmallow however, I have the option of entirely denying this permission when the game asks for it, and to also deny it permission to this indefinitely. 

		The key word here is ‘when’. Timing is exceptionally important here, and it’s this timing that will help educate users and ultimately help shine your app in a better light and build trust with users. You can build in some sort of info on your requested permissions during the introduction or “onboarding” of your app, which is a good way of getting some key permissions as quickly as possible. However, and this is just my opinion, I think that timing when using the app should make more sense to a lot of users. For instance, if I wanted to share a high-score with a friend of mine in a game, this is when the game needs to ask for permissions to my contacts. It makes total sense in that moment, and a lot of users will realize that right away, rather than asking for permission upfront, which will raise more questions. Why does a game I’m not playing with my friends need access to my Contacts? Timing is an important part of this fresh approach to permissions and access on Marshmallow. 

		We trust that Google will keep malicious apps out of the Play Store, and while they have struggled with that in the past, there’s still work to be done. As users, we need to start taking responsibility for ourselves, and it’s about time that Google gave us this power. I might enjoy using Hangouts on my device, but I don’t want it to have access to my Location, the same can be said for games, why do they need access to my contact information? Marshmallow represents a big change in the way that users and developers approach permissions in a world of significant danger online. Of course, now we just need to wait for the majority of Android users to actually get Android 6.0 Marshmallow, but that’s a problem for a different discussion.
