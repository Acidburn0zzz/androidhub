    Ok, so really quick, if you don't know what a [webview][1] is, let me share just a small amount to add some context to this post. A webview is when a native app provides a window for HTML. The HTML can be local or remote, cached or pulled fresh, etc. Apps use these for allllll sorts of different utilities: login portals, external content, ads, etc. 

    #### Ok cool, now what?

    Webview's are awesome, well I think so. They make it so easy to get external, dynamic and open content into your native app. What's learned quickly is that it's hard to make those experiences as fluid as the native app. I've been dropping content into webviews and building web experiences for a while now, let me share some of my findings so you don't have to bang your head as many times as I have over the years. I'll also be pitching [Bolt][3], which I've been maintaining for 2 years. It's a web app build framework that includes all the optimizations needed to have lightning fast web experiences on mobile.

    At a high level, **here's our topics**:
    - Memory
    - Compression
    - Cache
    - Headers
    - Manifest

    ## Memory
    First thing to note, which if it wasn't obvious, a webview will never have the power and memory that the native browser has. It's a browser inside of another app! I couldn't find any documented statements about memory comparisons betwee native and webview, but I've heard a webview has anywhere from 40% on iOS to 70% on Android. Meaning 70% of the resources are available for a webview, compared to native Chrome. That's considerably less, especially if the user is on an older device already. This is why it's topic 1. 

    #### Ok, so webviews are [nerfed][4], makes sense, now what?

    Biggest thing is to be considerate of this fact. Have an expectation that getting 100% smooth performance from your webview will be tough. If your goal is 100% buttery delicious interaction, then keep reading and practice these optimizations. 

    **Note:** Tools exist to help you investigate memory issues too, [vorlon.js][5] is a great tool for this, especially if the content is not local.

    ## Compression (aka turbo crunch)
    In a webview we're dealing with a tiny brain, that's kinda weak, so we need to compress all of our assets as small as we can. This doesn't just effect page load speed, it also effects the webview's ability to paint and layout. Therefore, we crunch all the things!

    #### Images
    Png's, crunch em. Jpg's, crunch em. SVG's, CRUNCH EM! Do this either with tools like [Smaller][6] or from the CLI with [Imagemin][7] and [SVGmin][8].

    #### Javascript
    With Javascript, it's all about obfuscation, minification, and concatenation. Luckily, you generally don't need 3 tools to accomplish. I like [Uglify][9], which is a one stop shop for all your JS crunching needs. A really cool thing about this crunch task, is that you'll have noticely faster application performance for crunching your scripts. Less for the compiler to read and parse, less memory consumed.

    #### CSS
    Just like with Javascript, you'll  want to minify and concatenate your style files. All the same benefits apply. But there is another way to optimize CSS, removing all the unused styles from your CSS, so the file is as tiny as it can be and has no waste. I like [Purify][10], it seems the most robust and least harmful.

    #### HTML
    Don't forget to minify your HTML, it again provides all the performance features of the other optimizations. It's often forgotten, but trust me, it's worth it.

    [Bolt][3] has all of these super crunching tools setup for you =)

    ## Cache
    Without diving into the deep waters of browser cache systems, I'm going to tell you about my preferred techniques for super cache. Let me present, [HTML5 AppCache][11] via the AppCache Manifest. I like to generate these dynamically, but there are simple to manually manage as well. What they do is powerful, almost so powerful it's hard to get rid of the files from cache (but that's not the case). 

    ```html
    <html manifest="manifest.appcache">
    ```

    By simply adding the `manifest` attribute to your `<html>` tag, you point to a file that tell the browser how to cache the site.

    ```yml
    CACHE MANIFEST
    # This manifest was generated by grunt-manifest HTML5 Cache Manifest Generator
    # Time: Mon Jun 29 2015 12:02:29 GMT-0700 (PDT)

    CACHE:
    js/app.min.js
    styles/app.css
    assets/icons/apple-touch-icon.png
    assets/icons/chrome-touch-icon.png
    assets/icons/favicon.ico
    assets/icons/ms-touch-icon.png
    assets/images/bolt.jpg

    NETWORK:
    *
    ```

    There's the manifest file in all it's glory. Simple paths to files and media. The browser will download these to the users device, and load straight from those files on subsequent requests. This even enables offline view ability! Talk about fast, there's no wait time anymore. 

    ## Headers
    In your HTML, you can help tell the browser about the content you're providing. Telling the browser that the content is mobile friendly, will enable a few really nice features that increase the percieved speed of your app. 

    ```html
    <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no">
    <meta name="HandheldFriendly" content="true">
    <meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
    ```

    The most important thing that these headers do for you, is remove the [300ms click delay][12] that's in browsers by default. Trust me when I say that this may be the most important piece for you to take away from this article. That tap/click delay alone will make your webview feel sluggish. 

    We could go deeper, crazy I know, but follow the tips in this article for a very noticeable boost to the responsiveness of your UI in a webview. Hope this helps you, and be sure to check out Bolt if you are in control of the webview architecture, it set's you up for success.
