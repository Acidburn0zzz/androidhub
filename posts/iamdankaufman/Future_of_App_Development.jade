    Formerly it was said that there is nothing that Google doesn’t know, however, this verity is now true for mobile phone applications too. From playing games to scientific calculator utility and from mobile phone shopping applications for almost anything and everything is probable in the app world. With 14 million apps and 3.2 billion users on app stores, there is a sturdy struggle when we talk about apps in the app store. These application development companies are spending a lot of money on marketing and app development as the Darwin’s law of “survival of fittest” operates in app world as well. 

    Be it android or iOS or windows all of them are facing a hard-hitting antagonism. With unique ideas of application development coming everyday it is important to understand what’s next. We are all aware of the first mover advantage, that the one who will craft the best solution at the earliest to the problem through its application will be a sure winner in any scenario. 

    Here are the upcoming trends in application development in near future –

    ## 1. Wearable and Smart Objects
    It all started by GARMIN followed by world electronic giant SAMSUNG and Now even APPLE is in the race. Apple has just launched a new smart watch. It is the first phase of iOS on smart watch. They have a new challenge of designing their apps compatible with the new wearable and also to design something that adds value preposition.  To date most of the applications that are offered by the developers are basically based on health and fitness. But the time is about to change, the future teller of developers are predicting that one day using smart phones will be calibrated by the market of smart wearable. New devices are tested and experimented every day, so developers have a challenge to adapt their applications accordingly.

    ## 2. App Security
    Once upon a time it was said that it is almost impossible to breach security offered by Apple. iOS being a popular platform which markets itself as the safest operating system for smartphones. The company follows a zero tolerance policy towards any security threat. Your smart phones carry your personal as well as business related data. Hackers are always in pursuit to fetch this data from weak application base of the application, accessing to all confidential data on the mobile phone. Hence app security is the biggest threat to any application and therefore the developers should code application in such a way that these facades no more threat to anyone.

    ## 3. Location based Wifi
    Like I-Beacon technology, these 21st century smartphones are highly interactive and marketer can use this for marketing the products. These devices will interact with your mobile phones when you come across a wifi device and will send you information regarding their offerings. Developers must focus on the potential of this technology and should develop the software keeping this boon industry in the mind.

    The app development environment is very dynamic and thus developers should always update themselves on the current trends in iOS application development.
