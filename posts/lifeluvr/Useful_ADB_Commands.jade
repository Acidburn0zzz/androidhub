		For this tutorial you will need to have _ADB_ installed on your computer, your Android's _USB Debugging_ set to _ON_ and your device plugged into your computer! Ready?  

		Here's the #1 _ADB_ command!  
		In your computer's terminal, type:

		```
		~$ adb devices
		```

		Basically, this is a system check. It tells if you have good connection and if your settings are correct!

		These next two commands are pretty easy to understand.  
		They're used to start and stop the _ADB_ server!

		```
		~$ adb start-server
		~$ adb kill-server
		``` 

		The next command (my favorite) is: 

		```
		~$ adb install /path/to/.apk
		```

		The way I like to use this command is to type, "adb install " (space after install). Then, _drag n' drop_ any .apk file from anywhere onto the terminal and press _Enter_ for super fast app installs from your computer!

		Now, we'll look at the reboot commands:

		```
		~$ adb reboot
		~$ adb reboot-recovery
		~$ adb reboot-bootloader
		```
		
		That's right! You can reboot your devices into 3 different modes without touching it! That's pretty awesome if you ask me!

		The next two commands are kind of the same but opposite:

		``` 
		~$ adb push /file/to/push /where/to/push it
		```

		To understand this better we'll use the old _drag n' drop_ trick! Type, "adb push " (space after push). Then, _drag n' drop_ the file you want to push to your Android. Lastly, tell the file where to go!
		Example:

		```
		~$ adb push /home/Downloads/awesome.mp3 /sdcard/Music/
		```

		Now for the other one:

		```
		~$ adb pull /file/to/pull /where/to/put it
		```

		Let's use _adb push_'s example but, switched around a little bit. This is because we're pulling from the Android device instead!
		Example:

		```
		~$ adb pull /sdcard/Music/awesome.mp3 /home/Downloads/
		```
