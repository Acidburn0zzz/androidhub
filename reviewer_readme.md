This page will have a list of article submissions. I suggest playing around here and learning what's going on. For example, you can view old submissions, rejected submissions, etc. All the history is preserved and openly viewable for anyone. By clicking on a pull request (PR), you'll find yourself at the PR detail. 

The PR detail will show you all the files changed by the author, with commentary, as well as whether or not the submission is passing the build test.
